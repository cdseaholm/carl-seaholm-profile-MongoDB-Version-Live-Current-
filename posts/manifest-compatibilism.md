****MANIFEST COMPATIBILISM****  
**I hereby coin: MANIFEST COMPATIBILISM**  
*November 4, 2025 — Carl Seaholm*
\
\
**Definition**:  
Free will and determinism are compatible when agency emerges from a **personal manifest** — a unique, evolved internal code (DNA, memory, culture, habits) that generates choices consistent with the self, even in a fully simulated or deterministic universe.
\
\
**Core Claim**:  
You don’t need to break the simulation theory in order to be free or have free will.  
You just need to *be* the cause — and your manifest *is* the cause of your actions. If we are all given an indepth manifest from birth, we are guided by this manifest in order to make our decisions that affect the simulation.
\
\
**Example**:  
- An algorithmic universe may be given a parameter to create a manifest for everything it creates. 
- As life begins to emerge, the manifest of these choice-making objects becomes more and more complex.
- The choices, guided but not determined by their manifest, affect the state of the superposition in which the simulation lives.
- This helps the simulation choose the branch from its superposition state.  
\
\
**Why it works**:  
No Gödel paradoxes. No hypercomputation.  
Just complex, individualized structure that *feels* like freedom.
In other words, your choices arise from your manifest — shaped by your history and values, not external control. The choice is yours, within the system, letting free will and determinism coexist.

\
**Credit**:  
Inspired by Hume, Dennett, and a lengthy chat with @grok to make sure I am thinking about it correctly.
\
\
**Quick Context**:  
Hume saw the self as a “bundle” of perceptions and habits — no fixed soul needed.  
Dennett says free will is about *control and competence*, not breaking causality.  
**Manifest Compatibilism** merges them: your bundle = your manifest = your freedom, even in a simulation.
