# Gentleness and why this approach is the way, not aggression

There is a succession of thought occurring lately in our society, that in order to make people understand your ideas, you must vehemently refuse anything that is put forward from an opposing point of view. That these points of view must be so incoherently wrong that they are borderline psychopathic to even think. Further more, the people who have these ideas and the epitome of evil. I believe that this is the wrong way to think and to act. 

If we sit down and ask what makes us human. What makes us, well, us. It would be boiled down to a culmination of our backgrounds, communities, upbringing, genetics, etc. All sorts of factors play into how we think, what we do and what we say. We need to realize that if we were in another’s shoes, we would most likely think the exact same thing. 

If this is true, then why do we attack each other with the ferocity you’d use on a thief of a kidnapper? A lot of it might be moral positioning. But I think a lot of it has to do with this protection of our own identities and thoughts. When we are challenged on ideas that we have come to grow around and hold close, we get so attached that we will protect them at any cost. Then, if someone attacks us and challenges that idea, we get vicious in response and the response to that is vile as well. I believe that’s where this cycle of hatred comes from. So we must first realize attacking someone’s idea, is like attacking someone for their ability to jump. It’s pointless to think you can change it immediately.

When it comes to this aggression towards ourselves, however, how can we separate our defense of ideas while accurately critiquing yourself? When you tell yourself daily that you’re worthless or these ideas you have are terrible, that itself becomes the idea you grow around. How to combat this again, is gentleness.

For a moment imagine a cat or dog, do you get it to come to you by yelling and berating it? No, you gently extend your hand and ask for it nicely. Gentleness, in my opinion, is the answer we so often desire from others, yet give none to the world or ourselves. 

If we approach every idea we have, regardless if it’s good or bad, gently, then we will come out of it with a better and more defined idea. Don’t just immediately stamp it as bad or terrible. Slowly work into it, what is good about it? What is bad? How did you come to this idea? Work through it and try to sift out what is needed and what is not. 

For example, take this blog. When I first started, I immediately thought, “You’re not writing, just stick to reading books.” However, a good friend let me know that she would actually really enjoy reading my material. So, I gently went about starting the page, then building the site, then writing my first post, then beginning an Instagram. Giving myself small goals and deadlines. Over time, it’s amazing how far I’ve come and how far I still have yet to go. 

If you apply this idea of gentleness to yourself, arguments, others, even life, not only will you be better but so will the world. We need to understand that ideas are ever changing and relative to the current situation and landscape that has been presented to us. If we do nothing but yell and shout for them to change immediately, we might as well be trying to disassemble the ground with our voice. But if we gently allow there to be time and care behind everything we do. There becomes room for growth within ourselves and within others. So be more understanding, give it time and above all, be gentle. We are all constantly changing and trying our best with what we are given.
