# My Portfolio

This portfolio is a showcase of my previous roles, current projects, and hobbies. It's built with a variety of modern web technologies and designed to be scalable and easy to update.

## Overview

The portfolio is divided into three main sections:

1. **Previous Roles/Work**: A detailed look at my professional history and the roles I've held.
2. **Current Projects**: An overview of the projects I'm currently working on, with links to live demos and source code.
3. **Hobbies**: A personal section where I share my current hobbies.

## Technology Stack

This portfolio is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: NextJS, Javascript, Typescript, TailwindCSS, React
- **Backend**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Data Fetching**: REST APIs

## Architecture

The architecture of this portfolio is designed to be scalable and easy to update. I have a mixture of hardcoded data and data fetched from MongoDB on their Atlas (free version). This could possibly change once budget constraints are lifed.

## Running Locally

To run this portfolio on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

The portfolio will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
It is also available at http://www.carlseaholm.com without the auth/DB functionality.

## Future Plans

Building this out into a larger Professional and Personal portfolio for non-technical individuals to use. This way they can showcase both their personal and professional lives. Stay tuned for updates!
